//! Formally Verified Risk Engine for Perpetual DEX — v12.19.13
//!
//! Implements the v12.19.13 spec.
//!
//! This module implements a formally verified risk engine that guarantees:
//! 1. Protected principal for flat accounts
//! 2. PNL warmup prevents instant withdrawal of manipulated profits
//! 3. ADL via lazy A/K side indices on the opposing OI side
//! 4. Conservation of funds across all operations (V >= C_tot + I)
//! 5. Bankruptcy socialization primarily through explicit A/K state. In the rare
//!    case of K-space i128 overflow during ADL, the remaining deficit falls to
//!    implicit global haircut (h) rather than panicking — preserving liquidation
//!    liveness at the cost of reducing the opposing side's junior PnL claims.
//!
//! # Atomicity Model
//!
//! Public functions suffixed with `_not_atomic` can return `Err` after partial
//! state mutation. **Callers MUST abort the entire transaction on `Err`** —
//! they must not retry, suppress, or continue with mutated state.
//!
//! On Solana SVM, any `Err` return from an instruction aborts the transaction
//! and rolls back all account state automatically. This is the expected
//! deployment model.
//!
//! Public functions WITHOUT the suffix (`top_up_insurance_fund`,
//! `deposit_fee_credits`, `accrue_market_to`) use validate-then-mutate:
//! `Err` means no state was changed.
//!
//! Internal helpers (`enqueue_adl`, `liquidate_at_oracle_internal`, etc.)
//! are not individually atomic — they rely on the calling `_not_atomic`
//! method to propagate `Err` to the transaction boundary.
